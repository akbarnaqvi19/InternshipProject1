Project 1:

The Project aims to train a basic linear regression model to predict housing price 

The Dataset is preprocessed to ease in the training of the algorithm

The Model is trained and stored as a (.pkl) file

The Trained Model is then called when the Testing code is run
Inputs are taken from the user at run time and a Predicted price is displayed
